This project aims to create an API in the form of a movie application using Rshiny. 
The URL of the API is: https://serenagruarin.shinyapps.io/projet_rshiny/
If you want to run the code from Rstudio, the two scripts "ui" and "server", a folder named "data" containing the csv file "movies" and a folder named "www" containing the images must be in the same folder
Then your directory path must be this folder, and you must execute in the console "RunApp(getwd)".
If you have any problem with the execution, you can contact me by mail : serena.gr@outlook.com
